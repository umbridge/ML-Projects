## Task 4: To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm
### Problem statement 
**For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and
visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.**


### Steps

**Install the libraries if not present.
Note:** 
This algorithm is executed in google colaboratory, for executing this on any other platform , install the required libraries

**Importing the libraries**

**Load the iris dataset**

**Data Analysis**

**statistics of the data**

**Graphical Representation**

**Model Training**

**Building Decision Tree Classifier**

**Model Testing**

**Visualizing Decision Tree**
